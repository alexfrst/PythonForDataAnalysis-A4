    <p class="lead">Sorry this file isn't available, our notebook is well rendered only by Visual Studio Code with the python module enabled. With the Jupyter html renderer or the pdf renderer we're lacking a lot of our graphs, that's why we do not show the notebook on the website and we highly encourage you to to use vscode </p>
